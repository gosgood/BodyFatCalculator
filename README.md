Body Fat Percentage Calculator
==============================

This application estimates the body fat percentage of a person based on various measurements.  In order to calculate your body fat percentage, you first need to take the following measurements:
* Your weight, in pounds
* Your waist size (at the navel), in inches
* The circumference of your wrist, in inches
* The circumference of your hip (at its fullest), in inches
* The circumference of your forearm (at its fullest), in inches

You also need to specify your gender, as body fat averages for men and women are significantly different.  Note that the wrist, hip, and forearm measurements are only used if you specify "female" as your gender.

The application will take these measurements and use a simple mathematical formula on the server side to calculate its estimate of your body fat percentage.  This estimate is shown on the right side of the page.
